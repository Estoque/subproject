1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,780
Unbelievable. It was brilliant!

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:07,630
I loved it. It was...

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,560
It's really good.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:16,030
All right, OK, let's get this over with.

5
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:20,810
Come on then, Mr F1 Fan, I'm braced
and ready for your comments. Go.

6
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:24,590
I agree with you. Eh?
I do agree with you.

7
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:29,690
The Americans are very bad at some
things, they can't say aluminium,

8
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:32,120
and they can't win a
war without our help,

9
00:00:32,172 --> 00:00:36,800
but they are very good
at making dreary sports

10
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:38,880
very exciting to watch.

11
00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:42,220
Let's just take, for an
example, rounders. Right?

12
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:44,930
That's played by small
children here, over there,

13
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:46,650
it's Babe Ruth, and a religion.

14
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:50,180
Then you've got netball which
here is schoolgirls standing,

15
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:53,850
so you can only move one foot, and
there's four parents watching,

16
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:56,970
and over there it's, what is it?
Harlem Globetrotters.

17
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:58,910
They are quite easily amused.

18
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,030
Unbelievably easily
amused, and that's why

19
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:03,100
they're able to make
NASCAR exciting.

20
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,230
It's just some good ol' boys going
round in a circle. And they go,

21
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:08,220
"Oh, hell, I'll go pay to watch that."

22
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:12,610
250,000 people turn up to watch it.
Because it is a good sport.

23
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:16,220
I mean Hammond you would say that,
because you're an American.

24
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:19,130
Wait a minute, I'm not.

25
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:24,240
You've got a Stetson, cowboy boots,
chaps, a Harley-Davidson, a Mustang,

26
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:26,460
you like to get a beer and you
put cheese on everything.

27
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:28,550
I don't! I'm not American.

28
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:31,000
You have made a living out
of being... an American.

29
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:32,960
Your Saturday night programme is

30
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,090
a fat man falling off some foam rubber.

31
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,870
"Oh, right, hey, we'll watch that!"

32
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:40,790
Then they turn up in their millions.

33
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:44,040
APPLAUSE

34
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:47,050
JAMES HUMS STAR SPANGLED BANNER

35
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:49,290
I'm not an American.

36
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:55,050
Look, Hammond, I wish the
Americans... ran a decent sport,

37
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,580
if they got Formula 1, it would be
fantastic, because they would say,

38
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:02,400
"Let's have sprinklers
coming on at random points

39
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:04,200
"during the race," and
that would be fantastic.

40
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:05,600
There would be no more
stewards' enquiries,

41
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:07,070
and there will be no more of this,

42
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,670
"You've got a ten second drive-by
penalty," which ruins the race.

43
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,220
They would say, "Hamilton and
Masa... you don't get on,

44
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:14,790
after the race, in your boxes,

45
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,650
"on the winner's podium, slug it out."

46
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:18,900
Yeah. I'd watch that,
would you watch that?

47
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,730
I'd watch that. It would be brilliant.
I would watch that.

48
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:23,300
Anyway, we must do the news.

49
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,330
We are starting with the
Institute of Advanced Motorists,

50
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:27,580
you know the ones.

51
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:29,460
Oh, yeah, them.

52
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,860
They are the ones who...

53
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:35,140
They say that you mustn't cross
hands on the steering wheel.

54
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:37,460
You've got to shuffle it, like that.

55
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,180
Never drive one-handed,
they don't like that.

56
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,860
They prefer that.

57
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:44,960
Is anyone here in The Institute
of Advanced Motorists?

58
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:46,890
Like you are going to confess it now.

59
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:48,910
You are! So you are in the Institute?

60
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,960
So, you do this?

61
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:52,960
Did you drive down...
here today like this?

62
00:02:56,808 --> 00:03:00,260
You're a passenger?
Oh, you can knock yourself out, then.

63
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:10,910
The Institute of Advanced Motorists...
has launched a new thing called,

64
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,480
Drive And Survive.

65
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:15,090
What, rather than Drive And Die?

66
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,580
That would never work.
Drive And Survive, OK?

67
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,230
The idea is, what they've got is,

68
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:23,770
every week they're
offering motoring tips.

69
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:25,520
Yes, so this week it's parking.

70
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,640
I'll give you a couple of examples
they've come up with, right?

71
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:32,400
"Park on the left-hand side
of the road if possible,

72
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:33,990
"and always at night."

73
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:39,080
Eh? What happens if you
arrive at lunch time?

74
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:42,840
I parked here this morning.
You didn't! I did. You idiot!

75
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:45,800
Park always at night.
Another one, right?

76
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:47,990
This is one I really can't get.

77
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:51,480
"When parking, open your
window in car parks,

78
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:55,490
"and turn off your stereo.
You can often hear something,

79
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:57,730
"before you can see it."

80
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:03,710
What, a lamppost? Lampposts actually
make a very soft cooing sound.

81
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,860
Do they?

82
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:10,360
I once heard a squelching
sound, and then a pop,

83
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,080
but that was the neighbour's cat!

84
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:15,690
Can we move on? Yes.

85
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:18,560
I have some news, there is a new
Dodge Viper being announced,

86
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:21,520
and apparently it's going to employ
Fiat technology on it, which is...

87
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,420
They mean is there's a new one,
and it won't work properly.

88
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,120
They haven't said that.

89
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,130
I suspect that Dodge
are a little worried

90
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,630
about the styling they have chosen,

91
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:32,110
because this is the
photograph they have sent.

92
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:34,990
Doesn't tell you much, does it?

93
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:38,020
Doesn't tell you a lot. Maybe it's shy?

94
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:42,960
Hey, now, you know sometimes
you meet someone who has

95
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,000
a growth on their face, and it's
actually bigger than their face?

96
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:48,570
Have you ever seen that?

97
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,100
No, I mean... one of those
really ugly things.

98
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:55,850
No, this is just a face, I'm talking
about a growth. That's your face?

99
00:04:55,905 --> 00:05:00,590
I bring this up, because
there's a company in Japan

100
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,660
whose obviously used this growth thing

101
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,990
as an inspiration for their
new Prius campervan.

102
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,420
Here it is. Oh, God!

103
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,080
It's the elephant car. It is.

104
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:14,160
SLURS SPEECH: I'm so
pleased to meet you.

105
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:18,750
I hope nobody knocks my trailer over.
It's a monster.

106
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:21,600
You've got a double bed in the
and another one in that growth.

107
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:24,460
That is not a car that you
could talk to at a party,

108
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:26,610
unless you are looking
at something else.

109
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:29,980
I've got news from Renault,

110
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:31,560
they've got a new car, I've
got a picture of it here,

111
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,940
it's called the Influenza. Is it?
It isn't called the Influenza.

112
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:36,510
Well, it's something a bit like that.

113
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,920
It's electric, as you can, because
there it is plugged in, recharging.

114
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:43,440
I was wondering, when in the future,
when we're all driving electric cars,

115
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:46,280
the cities are full of
these charging points,

116
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:49,820
won't ten-year-old boys go
around unplugging cars?

117
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,600
That's what we would have
done when I was ten.

118
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:55,650
Do you have to be ten, why wouldn't...
you do that aged, I don't know, 52?

119
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,560
Well, quite.
You would know though... wouldn't you?

120
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:02,190
If you saw somebody parked, you
would just go... You would.

121
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:04,930
I wouldn't. Why would you do that?

122
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:08,430
Remember the early Fiat Panda, the
boxy one that Giugiaro designed,

123
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:10,920
whenever I walk past one of
those with a group of friends,

124
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:13,770
we always picked it up
and turned it around.

125
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,960
You could just...

126
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:18,000
I was going that way,
how is that happened?

127
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:20,040
In the same way as it's always great fun

128
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:23,120
to lock someone else's bicycle
up with your bicycle lock.

129
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,220
You're just a yobbo!

130
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:27,280
Come on, Hammond, you
must have done that?

131
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:30,760
Or throw a brick through their
window, or set fire to their shop.

132
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:34,910
If you go to Halfords, you buy a whole
load of really cheap bicycle locks.

133
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,630
The combination ones... Then go along
the street, locking people's bikes up.

134
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:41,480
Why would you do that?
Because it's funny!

135
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,120
No, it is, because you do it,

136
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:47,000
and I did this with Robert
Cook on York station, in 1978,

137
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:49,500
if it was your bicycle,
you'll know it was us.

138
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,440
You lock it, hide behind some bins,
Wait for them to come back.

139
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,920
They take their lock off,
"Yes, my bicycle's good,"

140
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:56,750
and they go off and go,

141
00:06:56,802 --> 00:07:00,190
"I didn't put that on there.
"People are watching, getting ideas...

142
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:04,270
Don't do this, ten-year-olds and
52-year-olds, we're not condoning this.

143
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:05,840
52-year-old children.

144
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:09,250
Or indeed unplugging
peoples' electric cars,

145
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:14,040
because when they come back and find
the range says two, it's not funny.

146
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,240
It is funny.
We're not saying you should do that.

147
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,400
No, you shouldn't.

148
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,590
Were just saying you can do that.

149
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,300
Last week we revealed that the
police were claiming that

150
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,500
driving under the influence
of a cold remedy

151
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,140
is the same as driving under
the influence of cocaine.

152
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,780
Now, I drove down here,

153
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,530
because I got a cold that
I haven't... mentioned,

154
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:37,980
I drove down here this morning
having taken some Day Nurse,

155
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:40,060
and I arrived without incident.

156
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:43,090
Did it make you very boring, and
overly confident at parties?

157
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:47,160
No, I'm always that, I was that anyway.

158
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:51,630
So, I'm just letting you know that Day
Nurse and driving are OK. I made it.

159
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:54,910
Yeah, on that subject actually
last week, you agreed,

160
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,530
in fact you challenged James
to do a lap of a track,

161
00:07:57,582 --> 00:08:00,880
you would be sewing on a button
at the same time as driving,

162
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:03,190
he would be in a sleeping bag.

163
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:05,470
Yes, and you would be
giving yourself pleasure.

164
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:11,340
Those are the rules, so are we going...
to have our race? We did promise.

165
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:17,320
I've forgotten my sleeping bag, sir,
I've been practising all week.

166
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:23,130
I promise we will do our sleeping
bag, sewing a button on,

167
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:26,320
and Hammond race before
the end of the series.

168
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:29,620
Moving on, Mercedes SLS,

169
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:33,240
James and Richard will tell you
that it's too big and too stupid.

170
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:35,450
It is. It is. No, it isn't.

171
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:39,200
It is a SUPERB car, and
as far as I'm concerned,

172
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:42,090
there is only one thing wrong with it...

173
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:44,340
its doors.

174
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:46,330
That two things!
Well, it is, it's too doors.

175
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:46,344
Thank you, Hammond.
