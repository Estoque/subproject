1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,396
Unbelievable. It was brilliant!

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:05,246
I loved it. It was...

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,176
It's really good.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,646
All right, OK, let's get this over with.

5
00:00:13,688 --> 00:00:18,426
Come on then, Mr F1 Fan, I'm braced
and ready for your comments. Go.

6
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:22,206
I agree with you. Eh?
I do agree with you.

7
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:27,306
The Americans are very bad at some
things, they can't say aluminium,

8
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:29,736
and they can't win a
war without our help,

9
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:34,416
but they are very good
at making dreary sports

10
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:36,496
very exciting to watch.

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,836
Let's just take, for an
example, rounders. Right?

12
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:42,546
That's played by small
children here, over there,

13
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:44,266
it's Babe Ruth, and a religion.

14
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:47,796
Then you've got netball which
here is schoolgirls standing,

15
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:51,466
so you can only move one foot, and
there's four parents watching,

16
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:54,586
and over there it's, what is it?
Harlem Globetrotters.

17
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,526
They are quite easily amused.

18
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:58,646
Unbelievably easily
amused, and that's why

19
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:00,716
they're able to make
NASCAR exciting.

20
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:03,846
It's just some good ol' boys going
round in a circle. And they go,

21
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,836
"Oh, hell, I'll go pay to watch that."

22
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:10,226
250,000 people turn up to watch it.
Because it is a good sport.

23
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,836
I mean Hammond you would say that,
because you're an American.

24
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,746
Wait a minute, I'm not.

25
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:21,856
You've got a Stetson, cowboy boots,
chaps, a Harley-Davidson, a Mustang,

26
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,076
you like to get a beer and you
put cheese on everything.

27
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:26,166
I don't! I'm not American.

28
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:28,616
You have made a living out
of being... an American.

29
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,576
Your Saturday night programme is

30
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,706
a fat man falling off some foam rubber.

31
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:35,486
"Oh, right, hey, we'll watch that!"

32
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:38,406
Then they turn up in their millions.

33
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:41,656
APPLAUSE

34
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:44,666
JAMES HUMS STAR SPANGLED BANNER

35
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,906
I'm not an American.

36
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:52,666
Look, Hammond, I wish the
Americans... ran a decent sport,

37
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,196
if they got Formula 1, it would be
fantastic, because they would say,

38
00:01:57,253 --> 00:02:00,016
"Let's have sprinklers
coming on at random points

39
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:01,816
"during the race," and
that would be fantastic.

40
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,216
There would be no more
stewards' enquiries,

41
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,686
and there will be no more of this,

42
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,286
"You've got a ten second drive-by
penalty," which ruins the race.

43
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:10,836
They would say, "Hamilton and
Masa... you don't get on,

44
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,406
after the race, in your boxes,

45
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,266
"on the winner's podium, slug it out."

46
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:16,516
Yeah. I'd watch that,
would you watch that?

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,346
I'd watch that. It would be brilliant.
I would watch that.

48
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:20,916
Anyway, we must do the news.

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,946
We are starting with the
Institute of Advanced Motorists,

50
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:25,196
you know the ones.

51
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,076
Oh, yeah, them.

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,476
They are the ones who...

53
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,756
They say that you mustn't cross
hands on the steering wheel.

54
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:35,076
You've got to shuffle it, like that.

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,796
Never drive one-handed,
they don't like that.

56
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:38,476
They prefer that.

57
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:42,576
Is anyone here in The Institute
of Advanced Motorists?

58
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:44,506
Like you are going to confess it now.

59
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:46,526
You are! So you are in the Institute?

60
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,576
So, you do this?

61
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:50,576
Did you drive down...
here today like this?

62
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:57,876
You're a passenger?
Oh, you can knock yourself out, then.

63
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:08,526
The Institute of Advanced Motorists...
has launched a new thing called,

64
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,096
Drive And Survive.

65
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,706
What, rather than Drive And Die?

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,196
That would never work.
Drive And Survive, OK?

67
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,846
The idea is, what they've got is,

68
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:21,386
every week they're
offering motoring tips.

69
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:23,136
Yes, so this week it's parking.

70
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,256
I'll give you a couple of examples
they've come up with, right?

71
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,016
"Park on the left-hand side
of the road if possible,

72
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:31,606
"and always at night."

73
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:36,696
Eh? What happens if you
arrive at lunch time?

74
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:40,456
I parked here this morning.
You didn't! I did. You idiot!

75
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:43,416
Park always at night.
Another one, right?

76
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:45,606
This is one I really can't get.

77
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:49,096
"When parking, open your
window in car parks,

78
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:53,106
"and turn off your stereo.
You can often hear something,

79
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,346
"before you can see it."

80
00:03:56,428 --> 00:04:01,326
What, a lamppost? Lampposts actually
make a very soft cooing sound.

81
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:03,476
Do they?

82
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:07,976
I once heard a squelching
sound, and then a pop,

83
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,696
but that was the neighbour's cat!

84
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:13,306
Can we move on? Yes.

85
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:16,176
I have some news, there is a new
Dodge Viper being announced,

86
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:19,136
and apparently it's going to employ
Fiat technology on it, which is...

87
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:22,036
They mean is there's a new one,
and it won't work properly.

88
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:23,736
They haven't said that.

89
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,746
I suspect that Dodge
are a little worried

90
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,246
about the styling they have chosen,

91
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:29,726
because this is the
photograph they have sent.

92
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:32,606
Doesn't tell you much, does it?

93
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,636
Doesn't tell you a lot. Maybe it's shy?

94
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:40,576
Hey, now, you know sometimes
you meet someone who has

95
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,616
a growth on their face, and it's
actually bigger than their face?

96
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:46,186
Have you ever seen that?

97
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:48,716
No, I mean... one of those
really ugly things.

98
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:53,466
No, this is just a face, I'm talking
about a growth. That's your face?

99
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:58,206
I bring this up, because
there's a company in Japan

100
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,276
whose obviously used this growth thing

101
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,606
as an inspiration for their
new Prius campervan.

102
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:06,036
Here it is. Oh, God!

103
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,696
It's the elephant car. It is.

104
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,776
SLURS SPEECH: I'm so
pleased to meet you.

105
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:16,366
I hope nobody knocks my trailer over.
It's a monster.

106
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:19,216
You've got a double bed in the
and another one in that growth.

107
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:22,076
That is not a car that you
could talk to at a party,

108
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:24,226
unless you are looking
at something else.

109
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:27,596
I've got news from Renault,

110
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,176
they've got a new car, I've
got a picture of it here,

111
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,556
it's called the Influenza. Is it?
It isn't called the Influenza.

112
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,126
Well, it's something a bit like that.

113
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:37,536
It's electric, as you can, because
there it is plugged in, recharging.

114
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:41,056
I was wondering, when in the future,
when we're all driving electric cars,

115
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,896
the cities are full of
these charging points,

116
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:47,436
won't ten-year-old boys go
around unplugging cars?

117
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:49,216
That's what we would have
done when I was ten.

118
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:53,266
Do you have to be ten, why wouldn't...
you do that aged, I don't know, 52?

119
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,176
Well, quite.
You would know though... wouldn't you?

120
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:59,806
If you saw somebody parked, you
would just go... You would.

121
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,546
I wouldn't. Why would you do that?

122
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:06,046
Remember the early Fiat Panda, the
boxy one that Giugiaro designed,

123
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,536
whenever I walk past one of
those with a group of friends,

124
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,386
we always picked it up
and turned it around.

125
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,576
You could just...

126
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,616
I was going that way,
how is that happened?

127
00:06:15,664 --> 00:06:17,656
In the same way as it's always great fun

128
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:20,736
to lock someone else's bicycle
up with your bicycle lock.

129
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:22,836
You're just a yobbo!

130
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:24,896
Come on, Hammond, you
must have done that?

131
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:28,376
Or throw a brick through their
window, or set fire to their shop.

132
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:32,526
If you go to Halfords, you buy a whole
load of really cheap bicycle locks.

133
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:36,246
The combination ones... Then go along
the street, locking people's bikes up.

134
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:39,096
Why would you do that?
Because it's funny!

135
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:40,736
No, it is, because you do it,

136
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:44,616
and I did this with Robert
Cook on York station, in 1978,

137
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:47,116
if it was your bicycle,
you'll know it was us.

138
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,056
You lock it, hide behind some bins,
Wait for them to come back.

139
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,536
They take their lock off,
"Yes, my bicycle's good,"

140
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,366
and they go off and go,

141
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:57,806
"I didn't put that on there.
"People are watching, getting ideas...

142
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:01,886
Don't do this, ten-year-olds and
52-year-olds, we're not condoning this.

143
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:03,456
52-year-old children.

144
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:06,866
Or indeed unplugging
peoples' electric cars,

145
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:11,656
because when they come back and find
the range says two, it's not funny.

146
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,856
It is funny.
We're not saying you should do that.

147
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:16,016
No, you shouldn't.

148
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:18,206
Were just saying you can do that.

149
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,916
Last week we revealed that the
police were claiming that

150
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,116
driving under the influence
of a cold remedy

151
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,756
is the same as driving under
the influence of cocaine.

152
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,396
Now, I drove down here,

153
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,146
because I got a cold that
I haven't... mentioned,

154
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:35,596
I drove down here this morning
having taken some Day Nurse,

155
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:37,676
and I arrived without incident.

156
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,706
Did it make you very boring, and
overly confident at parties?

157
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,776
No, I'm always that, I was that anyway.

158
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:49,246
So, I'm just letting you know that Day
Nurse and driving are OK. I made it.

159
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:52,526
Yeah, on that subject actually
last week, you agreed,

160
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:55,146
in fact you challenged James
to do a lap of a track,

161
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:58,496
you would be sewing on a button
at the same time as driving,

162
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:00,806
he would be in a sleeping bag.

163
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,086
Yes, and you would be
giving yourself pleasure.

164
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:08,956
Those are the rules, so are we going...
to have our race? We did promise.

165
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:14,936
I've forgotten my sleeping bag, sir,
I've been practising all week.

166
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:20,746
I promise we will do our sleeping
bag, sewing a button on,

167
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:23,936
and Hammond race before
the end of the series.

168
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:27,236
Moving on, Mercedes SLS,

169
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,856
James and Richard will tell you
that it's too big and too stupid.

170
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:33,066
It is. It is. No, it isn't.

171
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:36,816
It is a SUPERB car, and
as far as I'm concerned,

172
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:39,706
there is only one thing wrong with it...

173
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:41,956
its doors.

174
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,946
That two things!
Well, it is, it's too doors.

175
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:46,954
Thank you, Hammond.
